<h1>IWU ROOMMATE FINDER</h1>
<h5>Created by Cynthia Carter, Evan Sauers, and Joshua Schoonmaker</h5>

The purpose of the Indiana Wesleyan University Roommate Finder is to create a website application that allows the students of the university to find their ideal roommate. The current roommate survey process is outdated and ineffective. Our goal is to deevelop the webstie application to allow the user to create a profile, take the sruvey, and find their matches.
